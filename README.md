# Odin Recipes

A simple website to practice basic HTML and Git workflows, built as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) foundational curriculum.

## 📚 Project Overview

This project is part of **The Odin Project's Foundations course**. It focuses on creating a basic HTML website from scratch and reinforcing core concepts like:

- Structuring an HTML document
- Using headings, paragraphs, links, images, and lists
- Working with Git and GitHub
- Creating multiple pages and linking them together

The final result is a simple recipes website with links to individual recipe pages.
