        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>These vegetable pakoras are delicious. You'll love this recipe if you've ever had 
            Japanese tempura-coated veggies. These pakoras are similar, but the spiced batter 
            gives them a unique taste. Serve with chili sauce, mint yogurt sauce, or sweet and 
            sour sauce. Try this recipe with other vegetables, such as sweet potatoes, broccoli, and 
            asparagus.</p>
